\subsection{Problem}
Let $x$ be a nilpotent element of a ring $A$. Show that $1 + x$ is a unit of  $A$. Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.

\subsection{Solution}
Note the identity $\left(\sum_{i = 0}^k x_i \right) (1-x) =  1- x^{k+1}$. Since $x$ is nilpotent,  $x^l = 0$ for some $l \geq 1$. Thus, if we set $k = l-1$ in the identity above, we see that $1-x$ has a multiplicative inverse, and is therefore  a unit. 

To prove the original statement, given that $x$ is a nilpotent unit, it is clear that $-x$ is nilpotent as well, and by the logic above, $1 - (-x) = 1 + x$ is a unit, as desired.

Suppose $u$ is an arbitrary unit. Since $x$ is nilpotent, $u^{-1}x$ is nilpotent as well, so by the above, $u^{-1}x + 1$ is a unit. Since the product of units is a unit, $u(u^{-1}x + 1) = x + u$ is a unit, as desired.

Let $A$ be a ring and let $A[x]$ be the ring of polynomials in an indeterminate $x$, with coefficients in $A$. Let $f = a_0 + a_1x + \cdots + a_n x^n \in A[x]$. Prove that

i) $f$ is a unit in $A[x] \Leftrightarrow a_0$ is a unit in $A$ and $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are nilpotent. 

ii) $f$ is nilpotent $\Leftrightarrow a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n$ are nilpotent.

iii) $f$ is a zero-divisor $\Leftrightarrow$ there exists $a \neq 0$ in $A$ such that $af = 0$.

iv) $f$ is said to be primitive if $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n) = (1)$. Prove that if $f,g \in A[x]$, then $fg$ is primitive $\Leftrightarrow f$ and $g$ are primitive.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring in which every element $x$ satisfies $x^n = x$ for some $n > 1$ (depending on $x$). Show that every prime ideal in $A$ is maximal.
\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a prime ideal. Then $A/\mathfrak{a}$ is an integral domain. Suppose that $x \in A$. Then $x^n = x$ for some $n > 1$. Let $\bar{x}$ be the image of $x$ under the projection to the quotient by $\mathfrak{a}$. Then $\bar{x}^n - \bar{x} = \bar{x} (\bar{x}^{n-1} - 1) = 0$. Since $A/\mathfrak{a}$ is an integral domain, this implies that either $\bar{x} = 0$ or $\bar{x}^{n-1} = 1$. If $\bar{x}^{n-1} = 1$, then $\bar{x} \cdot \bar{x}^{n-2} = 1$, so $\bar{x}$ has an inverse. This implies that for every $\bar{x} \in A/\mathfrak{a}$, either $\bar{x} = 0$ or $\bar{x}$ has an inverse. Thus, $A/\mathfrak{a}$ is a field, so $\mathfrak{a}$ is maximal, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an ideal $\neq (1)$ in a ring $A$. Show that $\mathfrak{a} = r(\mathfrak{a}) \Leftrightarrow \mathfrak{a}$ is an intersection of prime ideals.
\subsection{Solution}

$\Leftarrow$: Suppose $\mathfrak{a}$ is an intersection of prime ideals. Clearly, $\mathfrak{a} \subset r(\mathfrak{a})$. Suppose $x \notin \mathfrak{a}$. Then there is some prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ which $x$ is not in, but in which $\mathfrak{a}$ is contained. Thus, no power of $x$ will ever be in $\mathfrak{p}$, so no power of $x$ will ever be in $\mathfrak{a}$. Thus, $\mathfrak{a} = r(\mathfrak{a})$, as desired.

$\Rightarrow$:  Simply apply Proposition 1.14 - the radical of an ideal $\mathfrak{a}$, in this case $\mathfrak{a}$, is the intersection of the prime ideals which contain $\mathfrak{a}$.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring, $\mathcal{R}$ its nilradical. Show that the following are equivalent:

i) $A$ has exactly one prime ideal

ii) every element of $A$ is either a unit or nilpotent

iii) $A/\mathcal{R}$ is a field
\subsection{Solution}
.

i $\Rightarrow$ iii: Suppose $A$ has exactly one prime ideal. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$. Then this must be the unique prime ideal, so it is also the nilradical $\mathcal{R}$. Thus, $\mathcal{R}$ is maximal, so $A/\mathcal{R}$ is a field.

iii $\Rightarrow$ ii: Suppose $A/\mathcal{R}$ is a field. Then $R$ is maximal, so all the elements in $A - \mathcal{R}$ are units. All the elements within $\mathcal{R}$ are obviously nilpotent. Thus, every element of $A$ is either a unit or nilpotent, as desired.

ii $\Rightarrow$ i: Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal. Clearly it must contain all the nilpotent units and can contain none of the units. Thus, every prime ideal must contain exactly all of the nilpotents. Thus, $A$ has exactly one prime ideal.

\subsection{Problem}
A ring $A$ is Boolean if $x^2 = x$ for all $x \in A$. In a Boolean ring $A$, show that 

i) $2x = 0$ for all $x \in A$

ii) every prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal, and $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is a field with two elements

iii) every finitely generated ideal in $A$ is principal.
\subsection{Solution}

.

i) $(x +1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 = x + 2x + 1 = x + 1 \Rightarrow 2x = 0$, as desired.

ii) Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal. Then every element in $A/\mathfrak{p}$ satisfies $\bar{x}^2 = \bar{x}$. Since $A/\mathfrak{p}$ is an integral domain, this means that $\bar{x} = 0$ or $\bar{x} = 1$. Thus, $A/\mathfrak{p}$ has only two elements and is hence a field, so $\mathfrak{p}$ is maximal, as desired.

iii) It suffices to be able to reduce the ideal $(a, b)$ and show that it is equivalent to another ideal $(c)$. To this end, let $c = ab + a + b$. It is clear that $c \in (a,b)$. Next, $ca = a^2b + a^2 + ab = ab + a + ab = a$. Next, $cb = ab^2 + ab + b^2 = ab + ab + b = b$. Thus, $(a,b) = (c)$. So given any finite set of generators, we can reduce these to one generator, by induction, by reducing the number of generators one by one.

\subsection{Problem}
A local ring contains no idempotent $\neq 0,1$.
\subsection{Solution}
Let $x \in A$, the local ring. Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$. Suppose $x$ is idempotent. Then in $A/\mathfrak{m}$, $\bar{x}^2 = \bar{x} \Rightarrow \bar{x} ( \bar{x} - 1) = 0$. Since $A/\mathfrak{m}$ is a field, this implies that either $\bar{x} = 0$ or $\bar{x} = 1$.

If $\bar{x} = 1$, then $x$ is a unit, so if $x^2 = x$, then $x(x - 1) = 0$, so $x$ is either $0$ or $1$. $0$ is not a unit, so $x = 1$.

If $\bar{x} = 0$, then $x \in \mathfrak{m}$, so $x - 1$ is a unit. Since $x(x - 1) = 0$, this means that $x = 0$.

Thus, $x$ is either $0$ or $1$, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $K$ be a field and let $\Sigma$ be the set of all irreducible monic polynomials $f$ in one indeterminate with coefficients in $K$. Let $A$ be the polynomial ring over $K$ generated by indeterminates $x_f$, one for each $f \in \Sigma$. Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be the ideal of $A$ generated by the polynomials $f(x_f)$ for all $f \in \Sigma$. Show that $\mathfrak{a} \neq (1)$.

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ containing $\mathfrak{a}$, and let $K_1 = A/\mathfrak{m}$. Then $K_1$ is an extension field of $K$ in which each $f \in \Sigma$ has a root. Repeat the construction with $K_1$ in place of K, obtaining a field $K_2$, and so on. Let $L = \cup_{n=1}^{\infty} K_n$. Then $L$ is a field in which each $f \in \Sigma$ splits completely into linear factors. Let $\bar{K}$ be the set of all elements of $L$ which are algebraic over $K$. Then $\bar{K}$ is an algebraic closure of $K$.

\subsection{Problem}
In a ring $A$, let $\Sigma$ be the set of all ideals in which every element is a zero-divisor. Show that the set $\Sigma$ has maximal elements and that every maximal element of $\Sigma$ is a prime ideal. Hence the set of zero-divisors of $A$ is a union of prime ideals.
\subsection{Solution}
Any chain in $\Sigma$ has a maximal element - just take the union of all elements in the chain. It is clearly also an ideal in which every element is a zero-divisor. So Zorn's lemma implies that $\Sigma$ has maximal elements. 

Let $M$ be a maximal element of $\Sigma$. Then let $xy \in M$. If $x$ is not in $M$, then $M \cup \{x\}$ is a larger ideal than $M$ that is also an element of $\Sigma$, a contradiction.

Obviously the set of all zero-divisors is the union of the maximal ideals of $\Sigma$, so the set of zero divisors is a union of prime ideal.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring and let $X$ be the set of all prime ideals of $A$. For each subset $E$ of $A$, let $V(E)$ denote the set of all prime ideals of $A$ which contain $E$. Prove that

i) if $\mathfrak{a}$ is the ideal generated by $E$, then $V(E) = V(\mathfrak{a}) = V(r(\mathfrak{a}))$.

ii) $V(0) = X, V(1) = \emptyset$.

iii) If $(E_i)_{i \in I}$ is any family of subsets of $A$, then \[V (\cup_{i \in I} E_i ) = \cap_{i \in I} V(E_i).\]

iv) $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$ for any ideals $\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}$ of $A$.

\subsection{Solution}
.

i) If $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a})$, then $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, so $E \subset \mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $\mathfrak{p} \in V(E)$. So $V(\mathfrak{a}) \subset V(E)$. For the other direction, if $\mathfrak{p} \in V(E)$, then $E \subset \mathfrak{p}$. So $\mathfrak{p}$ must contain all the elements in the ideal generated by $E$, which is $\mathfrak{a}$. Thus, $\mathfrak{a} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, so $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a})$. Thus, $V(E) = V(\mathfrak{a})$. Next, let $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a})$. Let $x \in r(\mathfrak{a}) - \mathfrak{a}$, with $n \in \mathbb{N}$ being the minimal exponent such that $x^n \in \mathfrak{a}$. Clearly, $n > 1$. Then consider the fact that $x \cdot x^{n-1} \in \mathfrak{a}$. By the definition of $n$, both $x$ and $x^{n-1}$ are not in $\mathfrak{a}$. But $x^{n} \in \mathfrak{a} \Rightarrow x^n \in \mathfrak{p}$, so either $x$ or $x^{n-1}$ must be in $\mathfrak{p}$. If it is $x^{n-1}$, then we perform the same argument with $x$ and $x^{n-2}$, etc. until we reach the conclusion that $x \in \mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $r(\mathfrak{a}) \subset \mathfrak{p}$, so $\mathfrak{p} \in V(r(\mathfrak{a}))$. For the other direction, $V(r(\mathfrak{a})) \subset V(\mathfrak{a})$ is obvious because $\mathfrak{a} \subset r(\mathfrak{a})$. Thus, $V(E) = V(\mathfrak{a}) = V(r(\mathfrak{a}))$, as desired.

ii) $V(0) = X$, because every prime ideal contains $0$. $V(1) = \emptyset$, because if an ideal contains $1$, then it contains all of $A$ and it cannot be prime.

iii) If $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\cup_{i \in I} E_i)$, then $\mathfrak{p} \in V(E_i)$, $i \in I$, so $p \in \cap_{i \in I} V(E_i)$. If $\mathfrak{p} \in \cap_{i \in I} V(E_i)$, then $\cap_{i \in I} E_i \in \mathfrak{p}$, so $E_i \in \mathfrak{p}$, $i \in I$, so $\cup_{i \in I} E_i \subset \mathfrak{p}$, so $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\cup_{i \in I} E_i)$. Thus, $V (\cup_{i \in I} E_i ) = \cap_{i \in I} V(E_i)$, as desired.

iv) Since $\mathfrak{ab} \subset \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$, it is clear that $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) \subset V(\mathfrak{ab})$. Now suppose $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{ab})$. Now suppose $x \in \mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}$. Then clearly $x^2 \in \mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}$. So since $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, $x \in \mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $V(\mathfrak{ab}) \in V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$. Thus, $V(\mathfrak{ab}) = V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$. This could also have been proven by noting that $r(\mathfrak{ab})  = r(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$ and using part i. Next, let $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$. Suppose $\mathfrak{p}$ was a prime ideal such that $\mathfrak{a} - \mathfrak{p} \neq \emptyset, \mathfrak{b} - \mathfrak{p} \neq \emptyset$. Let $x \in \mathfrak{a} - \mathfrak{p}$ and $y \in \mathfrak{b} - \mathfrak{p}$. Then $xy \in \mathfrak{ab} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, but $x,y \notin \mathfrak{p}$, a contradiction. Thus, $\mathfrak{p}$ must contain either $\mathfrak{a}$ or $\mathfrak{b}$, so $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$. Next, suppose $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$. WLOG, suppose $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a})$. Then clearly $\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b} \subset \mathfrak{p}$, so $\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b})$. Thus, $V(\mathfrak{a} \cap \mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a}\mathfrak{b}) = V(\mathfrak{a}) \cup V(\mathfrak{b})$, as desired.

Show that $\left( \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \right) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}  \left( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \right) = 0$ if $m,n$ are coprime.
\subsection{Solution}
The tensor product is generated by all possible tensor products of pairs of generators from the two rings we are tensoring. Both rings are cyclic and are generated by 1. So the tensor product is generated by $1 \otimes 1$.  Now, note that $m (1 \otimes 1) = m \otimes 1 = 0 \otimes 1 = 0$, and $n (1 \otimes 1) = 1 \otimes n = 1 \otimes 0 = 0$. Thus, the order of $1 \otimes 1$ must divide both $m$ and $n$. However, since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, the only such positive number is 1. Thus, $1 \otimes 1$ has order 1, so $\left( \mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z} \right) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}  \left( \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \right)$ is a ring that contains only one element, which is therefore 0, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring, $\mathfrak{a}$ an ideal, $M$ an $A$-module. Show that $(A/\mathfrak{a}) \otimes_{A} M$ is isomorphic to $M/\mathfrak{a}M$.

\subsection{Solution}
Consider the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow \mathfrak{a} \rightarrow A \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{a} \rightarrow 0$. We now tensor this with $M$ to get $0 \rightarrow \mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow A \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \rightarrow 0$. By the first isomorphism theorem, we therefore have that $A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong A \otimes_{A} M / \mathfrak{a} \otimes_A M$. Clearly, $A \otimes_A M \cong M$ and $\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong \mathfrak{a} M$, so we have $A/\mathfrak{a} \otimes_{A} M \cong M/\mathfrak{a}M$, as desired.

\section{}

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a local ring, $M$ and $N$ finitely generated $A$-modules. Prove that if $M \otimes N = 0$, then $M = 0$ or $N = 0$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be the maximal ideal of $A$ and let $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$ be the residue field. Then $M_k = k \otimes_A M \cong M/\mathfrak{m}M$ by 3.2. Since $A$ is a local ring, $\mathfrak{m}$ is the only maximal ideal of $A$, so by Nakayama's lemma, if $M_k = 0$, then $M = 0$. 

Since $M \otimes_{A} N = 0$, $(M \otimes_{A} N)_k = M_k \otimes_{A} N_k = 0$. Since $M_k$ and $N_k$ are both vector spaces over a field, this implies that either $M_k = 0$ or $N_k = 0$, which implies that either $M = 0$ or $N= 0$, as desired.

\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
Let $M_i (i \in I)$ be any family of $A$-modules, and let $M$ be their direct sum. Prove that $M$ is flat $\Leftrightarrow$ each $M_i$ is flat.

\subsection{Solution}
$\Rightarrow:$ Suppose that $M$ is flat. The maximal ideals of $M$ are $\{\times_{i \neq j} M_i  \times \mathfrak{m}_j | j \in I, \mathfrak{m_j} \in M_j\}$, where $\mathfrak{m}_j$ are the maximal ideals of $M_j$. The quotients of all these maximal ideals must also be flat. These are all $M_j/\mathfrak{m}_j$, over all $j \in I$ and over all $\mathfrak{m}_j$ which are maximal in $M_j$. For a specific $j$, this implies that all the maximal ideals are flat. This implies that $M_j$ is flat. So this direction is done.

$\Leftarrow:$ Just go the other direction.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A[x]$ be the ring of polynomials in one indeterminate over a ring $A$. Prove that $A[x]$ is a flat $A$-algebra.
\subsection{Solution}
$A[x]$ is just the infinite direct sum of $A$, considered as an $A$-module, so $A[x]$ is flat if $A$ is flat as an $A$-algebra, by problem 2.4. But for any $A$-module $M$, $M \otimes_A A \cong M$, so clearly $A$ is flat. Thus, $A[x]$ is a flat $A$-algebra.


\section{}
\subsection{Problem}
For any $A$-module, let $M[x]$ denote the set of all polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $M$, that is to say expressions of the form \[m_0 + m_1x + \cdots + m_rx^r (m_t \in M)\]

Defining the product of an element of $A[x]$ and an element of $M[x]$ in the obvious way, show that $M[x] \cong A[x] \otimes_{A} M$.

\subsection{Solution}
From Proposition 2.14, we know that $(M + N) \otimes P \cong (M \otimes P) + (N \otimes P)$. We can consider $M[x]$ to be an infinite direct sum of $M$, and $A[x]$ to be an infinite direct sum of $A$. From Proposition 2.14, we know that when $M$ is a module of $A$, $A \otimes M \cong M$. These two facts immediately imply the desired conclusion, $M[x] \cong A[x] \otimes_A M$.

Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime ideal of $A$. Show that $\mathfrak{p}[x]$ is a prime ideal in $A[x]$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $f,g \in A[x] - \mathfrak{p}[x]$. Let \[f = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + \cdots a_n x^n\] and let \[g = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \cdots + b_m x^m\]

Suppose $a_i$ is the coefficient with smallest index that is not in $\mathfrak{p}$, and let $b_j$ be defined likewise. These must both exist because $f,g \notin \mathfrak{p}[x]$. Then consider the coefficient of $x^{i+j}$ in $fg$. WLOG, let $i < j$. Then the coefficient of $x^{i+j}$ in $fg$ is \[\sum_{r = 0}^{i-1} a_r b_{i+j-r} + a_i b_j + \sum_{s = 0}^{j-1} a_{i+j-s}b_s\]

Both the sums are in $\mathfrak{p}$ because $a_r \in \mathfrak{p}$ for $r < i$ and $b_s \in \mathfrak{p}$ for $s < j$, by the definitions of $i$ and $j$. But $a_i$ and $b_j$ are not in $\mathfrak{p}$, and $\mathfrak{p}$ is prime, so $a_i b_j$ is not in $\mathfrak{p}$. Thus, $fg$ is not in $\mathfrak{p}[x]$. Thus, $\mathfrak{p}[x]$ is prime in $A[x]$, as desired.

i) If $M$ and $N$ are flat $A$-modules, then so is $M \otimes_{A} N $.

ii) If $B$ is a flat $A$-algebra and $N$ is a flat $B$-module, then $N$ is flat as an $A$-module.

\subsection{Solution}

i) Let $0 \rightarrow B \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. Since $M$ is flat, \[0 \rightarrow B \otimes_A M \rightarrow C \otimes_A M \rightarrow D \otimes_A M \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Since $N$ is flat, 
\[0 \rightarrow (B \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow (C \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow (D \otimes_A M) \otimes_A N \rightarrow 0\] is also exact. By Proposition 2.14, $(M \otimes N) \otimes P \cong M \otimes (N \otimes P)$, so therefore we have 
\[0 \rightarrow B \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow C \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow D \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Thus, $M \otimes_A N$ is flat, as desired.

ii) Let $0 \rightarrow C \rightarrow D \rightarrow E \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. Since $B$ is a flat $A$-algebra, \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A B \rightarrow D \otimes_A B \rightarrow E \otimes_A B \rightarrow 0\] is exact. Since $N$ is a flat $B$-module, \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow D \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow E \otimes_A B \otimes_B N \rightarrow 0\] 

But $B \otimes_B N \cong N$, so we get 
 \[0 \rightarrow C \otimes_A  N \rightarrow D \otimes_A N \rightarrow E \otimes_A  N \rightarrow 0\] 

which implies that $N$ is flat as an $A$-module, as desired.

Let $0 \rightarrow M' \rightarrow M \rightarrow M'' \rightarrow 0$ be an exact sequence of $A$-modules. If $M'$ and $M''$ are finitely generated, then so is $M$.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_m$ be the generators of $M'$ and let $v_1, v_2, \cdots v_n$ be the generators of $M''$. Let $w_i = f(u_i), 1 \leq i \leq m$. Since $M$ surjects onto $M''$, for each of the $v_i$, there is an $x_i$ such that $f(x_i) = v_i$.

Let $f$ be the map from $M$ to $M''$ in the exact sequence. For each $m \in M$, either $m$ goes to 0 or $f(m)$ is a finite sum $s_1 v_1 + s_2 v_2 + \cdots + s_n v_n$. In the first case, it is in the submodule generated by $w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_m$. In the second case, it is in the submodule generated by $x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$. In all cases, $m$ is in the submodule generated by $w_1, w_2, \cdots, w_m, x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n$. Thus $M$ is finitely generated as desired.

Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$, let $k = A/\mathfrak{m}$, and let $\phi: A^m \rightarrow A^n$ be an isomorphism. Then $1 \otimes_k \phi: k \otimes_k A^m \rightarrow k \otimes_k A^n$ is an isomorphism of vector spaces of dimensions $m$ and $n$. Thus, $m = n$.

Let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module and $\phi: M \rightarrow A^n$ a surjective homomorphism. Show that Ker $(\phi)$ is finitely generated.

\subsection{Solution}
Ker $(\phi) \subset M$ and $M$ is finitely generated, so Ker $(\phi)$ must be finitely generated.

Let $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module. Prove that $S^{-1}M = 0$ if and only if there exists $s \in S$ such that $sM = 0$.

\subsection{Solution}
$\Leftarrow$: Let $m/t \in S^{-1}M$. Now note that $m/t  = 0/1 \Leftrightarrow mu = 0$ for some $u \in S$. But since $sM = 0$, $ms = 0$ for all $m \in M$, so setting $u = s$ establishes that $m/t = 0$, so $S^{-1}M = 0$.

$\Rightarrow$: Suppose that $S^{-1}M = 0$. Then for all $m/1 \in S^{-1}M$, we have $m/1 = 0/1$, so there exists a $u \in S$ such that $mu = 0$. Let $e_1, e_2, \cdots, e_n$ be the generators of $M$. Let their corresponding annihilators in $S$ be $u_1, u_2, \cdots, u_n$. Then $u_1 u_2 \cdots u_n$ annihilates every element of $M$. Thus, we are done.

Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be an ideal of a ring $A$, and let $S = 1 + \mathfrak{a}$. Show that $S^{-1}\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $S^{-1}A$. 

\subsection{Solution}
I will show that $\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in every maximal ideal of $A$. Suppose not. Then there would exist $a \in \mathfrak{a}$, $m \in M$ such that $a + m = 1$. This implies that $a$ is a unit. Thus, $\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in every maximal ideal of $A$. It is also clear that $\mathfrak{a}$ and $S$ are disjoint. By the one-to-one correspondence between prime ideals of $A$ and prime ideals of $S^{-1}A$, this means that $S^{-1}\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in all the maximal ideals of $S^{-1}A$. The one-to-one correspondence applies to maximal ideals because they are disjoint from $S = 1 + \mathfrak{a}$. If $m = 1 + a$, this implies that $a$ is a unit. Therefore, $S^{-1}\mathfrak{a}$ is contained in the Jacobson radical of $S^{-1}A$, as desired.

Let $A$ be a ring, let $S$ and $T$ be two multiplicatively closed subsets of $A$, and let $U$ be the image of $T$ in $S^{-1}A$. Show that the rings $(ST)^{-1}A$ and $U^{-1}(S^{-1}A)$ are isomorphic.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $f: (ST)^{-1}A \rightarrow U^{-1}(S^{-1}A)$ be defined by $f(a/st) = (a/s)/(t/1)$. This map is clearly surjective. Now suppose that $f(a_1/s_1t_1) = f(a_2/s_2t_2)$. Then $(a_1/s_1)/(t_1/1) = (a_2/s_2)/(t_2/1)$. Then there is some $a_3/s_3 \in S^{-1}A$ such that $((a_1/s_1)(t_2/1) - (a_2/s_2)(t_1/1))a_3/s_3 = 0 \Rightarrow (a_1 t_2/s_1 - a_2 t_1/s_2)a_3/s_3 = 0 \Rightarrow (a_1t_2s_2 - a_2 t_1s_1)/s_1 s_2 \cdot (a_3/s_3) = 0 \Rightarrow a_1t_2s_2a_3 - a_2 t_1 s_1 a_3 = 0 $ This means that $a_1/(s_1t_1) = a_2/(s_2t_2)$, so $f$ is injective as well. Thus, $f$ is an isomorphism, as desired.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring. Suppose that, for each prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$, the local ring $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ has no nilpotent element $\neq 0$. Show that $A$ has no nilpotent element $\neq 0$. If each $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ is an integral domain, is $A$ necessarily an integral domain?

\subsection{Solution}

Suppose $x \in A$ was nilpotent and $\neq 0$. It must be contained in every prime ideal, so let $\mathfrak{p}$ be some prime ideal of $A$. Let $y \in A - \mathfrak{p}$, which is clearly not nilpotent, and consider the element $x/y \in A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Suppose that $x^n = 0$. Then $(x/y)^n = x^n/y^n = 0/y^n$, which is equal to $0/1$, the zero element of $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$. This violates the assumption that $A_{\mathfrak{p}}$ has no nonzero nilpotent element. Thus we are done.

\subsection{Problem}
Let $A$ be a ring $\neq 0$ and let $\Sigma$ be the set of all multiplicatively closed subsets $S$ of $A$ such that $0 \notin S$. Show that $\Sigma$ has maximal elements, and that $S \in \Sigma$ is maximal if and only if $A -S$ is a minimal prime ideal of $A$.
\subsection{Solution}
$\Sigma$ has maximal elements by Zorn's lemma, because $A - \{0\}$ is a multiplicatively closed subset that contains all the others, and inclusion is a partial order. Suppose $S \in \Sigma$ is maximal. Consider $A - S$. If this was not prime, then $S$ would not be multiplicatively closed, because there would exist $x,y \in S$ such that $xy \in A - S$. Thus, $A-S$ is prime. Suppose that $A - S$ was not minimal, and suppose $T \subset S$ was a proper subset of $S$ forming a prime ideal. Then $A - T$ would be multiplicatively closed and contain $S$, which contradicts the fact that $S$ is maximal. Thus, $A-S$ is a minimal prime ideal, as desired.

For the other direction, suppose $A-S$ is a minimal prime ideal. Then clearly $S$ is multiplicatively closed by the definition of prime ideals. If $S$ was not maximal, then suppose $S \subset T$ for some $T$ that is multiplicatively closed. Then $A - T$ would be prime and be contained in $A - S$ which contradicts the fact that $A-S$ is minimal. Thus, we are done.

\subsection{Problem}
A multiplicatively closed subset $S$ of a ring $A$ is said to be \emph{saturated} if \[xy \in S \Leftrightarrow x,y \in S.\]
Prove that 

i) $S$ is saturated $\Leftrightarrow$ $A - S$ is a union of prime ideals.

ii) If $S$ is any multiplicatively closed subset of $A$, there is a unique smallest saturated multiplicatively closed subset $\bar{S}$ containing $S$, and that $\bar{S}$ is the complement in $A$ of the union of prime ideals which do not meet $S$. ($\bar{S}$ is called the \emph{saturation} of $S$.)

If $S = 1 + \mathfrak{a}$, where $\mathfrak{a}$ is an ideal of $A$, find $\bar{S}$.

\subsection{Solution}
.

i) Suppose $A-S$ is a union of prime ideals. Let $x,y \in S$. Then $xy$ cannot be in any of the prime ideals comprising $A-S$, so $xy \in S$. Next, suppose $xy \in S$. WLOG, if $x \in A - S$, then $x$ is in some prime ideal in $A-S$, so $xy $ is also in the same prime ideal, implying $xy \in A - S$, a contradiction. Thus, $x,y \in S$. Thus, $S$ is saturated.

For the other direction, suppose $S$ is saturated. Let $T$ be the union of all prime ideals which do not meet $S$. Let $x \in (A - S) - T$, and let $y \in S$. If $xy \in S$, then $x \in S$, a contradiction. If $xy \in T$, then $xy$ is in some prime ideal, but both $x$ and $y$ are not in that prime ideal, a contradiction. Thus, $xy \in (A-S) - T$. One can clearly see that $(A-S) - T$ must be a prime ideal, and it does not meet $S$, a contradiction because we defined $T$ be the union of all prime ideals that do not meet $S$. Thus, $(A-S)-T$ must be the empty set, so $A-S = T$, so $A-S$ is the union of prime ideals, as desired.

ii) Let $T$ be the union of all prime ideals that do not meet $S$, and consider $A-T$. This contains $S$, and is saturated by part i. Suppose there was a smaller set $U$ containing $S$ that is saturated. Then let $x \in (A-T) - U$. Then applying the same argument from part i, we see that $(A-T) - U$ is a prime ideal which does not meet $S$, and hence must be in $T$, a contradiction. Thus, $T$ is in fact the unique smallest saturated subset containing $S$, as desired.

$\bar{1 + \mathfrak{a}}$ is the complement of the union of all prime ideals that do not meet $1 + \mathfrak{a}$.

i) $\phi$ is bijective.

ii) For each $t \in T, t/1$ is a unit in $S^{-1}A$.

iii) For each $t \in T$ there exists $x \in A$ such that $xt \in S$.

iv) $T$ is contained in the saturation of $S$ (Exercise 7)

v) Every prime ideal which meets $T$ also meets $S$.

\subsection{Solution}
.

i $\Rightarrow$ ii: Since $\phi$ is surjective, for each $a/t \in T^{-1}A$, there exists $a_1/s \in S^{-1}A$ such that $a_1/s$, considered as an element of $T^{-1}A$, is equal to $a/t$. So $\exists u \in T$ such that $u(ta_1 - sa) = 0$. Since $\phi$ is injective, if $a_1/s_1 = a_2/s_2$ considered as elements of $T$, then they are equal considered as elements of $S$. In other words, if there exists $t_3 \in T$ such that $t_3 (s_2 a_1 - s_1 a_2) = 0$, then there exists a $s_3 \in S$ such that $s_3 (s_2 a_1 - s_1 a_2) = 0$.

\subsection{Problem}
The set $S_0$ of all non-zero-divisors in $A$ is a saturated multiplicatively closed subset of $A$. Hence the set $D$ of zero-divisors in $A$ is a union of prime ideals (see Chapter 1, Exercise 14). Show that every minimal prime ideal of $A$ is contained in $D$.

The ring $S_{0}^{-1}A$ is called the total ring of fractions of $A$. Prove that

i) $S_0$ is the largest multiplicatively closed subset of $A$ for which the homomorphism $A \rightarrow S_0^{-1}A$ is injective.

ii) Every element in $S_{0}^{-1}A$ is either a zero-divisor or a unit.

iii) Every ring in which every non-unit is a zero-divisor is equal to its total ring of fractions (i.e., $A \rightarrow S_0^{-1}A$ is bijective).


\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a minimal prime ideal. Then $A-\mathfrak{p}$ is a maximal multiplicatively closed subset of $A$. This means that it contains $S_0$, which means that $\mathfrak{p} \subset D$.

i) First, let us establish that $A \rightarrow S_{0}^{-1}A$ is injective. Suppose $a_1/s_1 - a_2/s_2 = 0$. Then there exists $u \in S_0$ such that $u(a_1 s_2 - a_2 s_1) = 0$. But this contradicts the fact that $u$ is a non-zero-divisor. Thus, this is indeed injective. To see that it is the largest such set, suppose we had a set $S_1$ with $S_0 \subset S_1$ which contained a zero-divisor $z$. Then I claim that $0/z = 1/z$. To see this, note that $0/z - 1/z = 0 \Leftrightarrow \exists u \in S_1, u(-z) = 0$. But such a $u$ clearly exists because $z$ is a zero-divisor. So the map is no longer injective.

ii) If $a/s$ is a zero-divisor, then there exists $a_1/s_1$ such that $aa_1/ss_1 - 0/1 = 0$, so in other words, $\exists u \in S_0$ such that $uaa_1 = 0$. But this is impossible because this would imply $u$ is a zero-divisor, unless $aa_1 = 0$. This happens if and only if $a$ is a zero-divisor. So if $a$ is not a zero-divisor, then $a/s$ is not a zero-divisor, for all $s \in S_0$. And these are precisely all the non-zero-divisors in $S_0^{-1}A$. Now clearly $a \in S_0$, so we can just take $s/a$ as the inverse of $a/s$ and see that it is a unit. Thus we are done.

iii)

\subsection{Problem}
If $\mathfrak{a} = r(\mathfrak{a})$, then $\mathfrak{a}$ has no embedded prime ideals.

\subsection{Solution}
Let $\mathfrak{a} = \cap \mathfrak{q}_i$ be the primary decomposition of $\mathfrak{a}$. Then $r(\mathfrak{a}) = r(\cap \mathfrak{q}_i) = \cap r(\mathfrak{q_i})$. Let $r(\mathfrak{q_i}) = \mathfrak{p}_i$. Then $r(\mathfrak{a}) = \mathfrak{a} = \cap \mathfrak{p}_i$. Since all prime ideals are primary, this is the primary decomposition of $\mathfrak{a}$. Clearly, there are no embedded ideals, because if there were, we could just remove them from this representation and it would remain the same. Thus, $\mathfrak{a}$ has no embedded ideals, as desired.
